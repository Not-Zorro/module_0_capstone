## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

* A method is a way to recall a process you created without having to constantly having to retype/recreate that process.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello
  p "Sam i am"
end
```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby 
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone("David")``

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

* No questions, pretty familiar with methods from my time programming in java and python!
